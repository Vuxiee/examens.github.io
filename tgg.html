    <h3>Excerpt of The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><u>What is the advice talked about in this excerpt?</u></li>
        <p>The advice is the one that the narratr's father told him: 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that all of the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you had.'</p>
        <li><u>Explain: 'Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.</u></li>
        <p>To reserve judgements: to keep your opinion to yourself.</p>
        <li><u>Do you think this advice is snobbish?</u></li>
        <p>Yes but also realistic (see quote). We don't all get the same chances in life, this influences who we are and what we do.</p>
        <li><u>What is the narrator's stance when it comes to Gatsby?</u></li>
        <p>He has a negative view of Gatsby but not for 100% (heightened sensitivity of promises of life + romantic readiness)</p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Clip: end of the story</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><u>What is the importance of the green light?</u></li>
        <p>Light to Gatsby represents a better future.</p>
        <li><u>Gatsby is famous for his parties. Why does he throw them?</u></li>
        <p>To lure Daisy into his parties.</p>
        <li><u>What happens to Gatsby? Why, do you think?</u></li>
        <p>He gets killed (by Myrtles).</p>
        <li><u>What do you learn about the narrator?</u></li>
        <p>He is also the writer of the book (therapeutic writing)</p>
        <li><u>What is the ultimate message of this book? (quote)</u></li>
        <p>"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back, ceaselessly, into the past." (Stuck in the past)</p>
        <p>Gatsby believed that things would get better, but reality throw us back. Pessimistic message (American Dream is a lie)</p>
